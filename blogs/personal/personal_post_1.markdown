	  <h2>Preface</h2>
	  <p>How I did this blog is nothing new, as a matter of fact many have done exactly what I did and it is well documented. This post is just on how I did it and since it is all very fresh in my mind I thought I would write a post about it.  For other tutorials on how to do this checkout these:</p>

	  <h2>GitHub</h2>
	  <p>I choose to use GitHub to host the blog using the GitHub Pages feature by creating a repository using my GitHub username.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Setup a free <a href="https://github.com/signup/free" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account, and follow the <a href="http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/" target="_blank">setup instructions</a>.</li>
		<li>Create a <a href="http://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Page</a> with your username.</li>		
	  </ul>
	  <p>It may take a little while for GitHub to setup your page but eventually it will start working and you'll have your GitHub page and an empty repository.</p>
