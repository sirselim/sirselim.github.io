  <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>This site acts as both a professonal and personal blog, mainly for me to bookmark and detail interesting thoughts, findings and random interests.</p>
      <p> I also use it to document various pieces of <code>code</code> that I've gathered, modified, or created - an electronic notebook for my records.</p>
      <p>It may someday prove useful for others.</p>
