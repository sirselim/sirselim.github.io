This is a very brief initial workshop designed to introduce Inkscape. The main goal here is to get a general overview of how to create a poster layout with Inkscape, get familiar with the software, and understand a little about putting a scientific poster together.  

A pdf version of this workshop can be downloaded [here](/workshops-tutorials/Basic_Inkscape_Poster_Design_Tutorial_150916.pdf).  

I'm aiming to have an online version of this workshop avaiable in the not too distant future, watch this space!
