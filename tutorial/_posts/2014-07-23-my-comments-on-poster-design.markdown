This is just a small comment piece I put together on [my] ideas behind the philosophy of design and scientific posters. It also includes quite a few links to sites and blogs that I have found useful and have got a lot of inspiration from.  

You can download these in pdf form [here](/tutorial/Considering_Poster_Design_and_Presentation_140722.pdf) if you like printing documents to read later.

I'm currently in the process of adding this material as an online post, so check back often!
