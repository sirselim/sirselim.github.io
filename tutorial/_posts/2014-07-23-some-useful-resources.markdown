This is a list of resources that I've found useful to combine as a handout for students (from teaching a range of different courses).  

You can download the list in pdf form [here](/tutorial/ResourceList.pdf) if you like printing documents to read later.  

I'm currently in the process of adding this material as an online post, so check back often!
