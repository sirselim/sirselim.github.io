At the bottom of the world in New Zealand, I am a computational geneticist 
interested in all facets of biology and technology. I am currently working 
at ESR ([Institute of Environmental Science and Research](www.esr.cri.nz)) 
as a Senior Bioinformatician. Technology and science geek that also dabbles 
at photography and electric guitar, with a side of coffee, beer and single 
malts thrown in the mix.
