At the bottom of the world in New Zealand, I am a computational geneticist 
interested in all facets of biology and technology. As of March 2022 I am working 
for [Oxford Nanopore Technologies](www.nanoporetech.com) 
as a Senior Bioinformatician. Technology and science geek that also dabbles 
at photography and electric guitar, with a side of coffee, beer and single 
malts thrown in the mix.
