At the bottom of the world in New Zealand, I am a computational geneticist 
interested in all facets of biology and technology. I am currently working 
at ESR ([Institute of Environmental Science and Research](www.esr.cri.nz)) 
as a Senior Bioinformatician. I also dabble at photography and guitar, with 
a side of coffee, beer and single malts in the mix.
