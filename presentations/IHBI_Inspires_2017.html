&lt;br &gt;

.large[

  - Using WGS and founder effect in NI may reveal disease-related variants that are rare in general populations

&lt;br &gt;

  - Focusing on “functional” SNVs has identified strong candidate variants  
  
    + performing genotyping in the rest of the pedigree

&lt;br &gt;

  - Some early evidence of association with T2D and CVD-related traits

# Allele-specific Methylated Regions (AMRs)

#### Overlap with known imprinting genes

  - there are &lt;span style="color:lightblue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;91&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; known imprinted genes with strong evidence
  - we have identified &lt;span style="color:lightblue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;12761&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; total AMR (&gt;=2 CpG sites)
  - we recoup 72/91 (&lt;span style="color:lightblue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;79%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) of the above known genes

--

#### Small AMRs (&gt;=2 CpG sites and &lt;= 200bp length)

  - there are &lt;span style="color:lightblue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;4731 small AMR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; which collectively span 6987 genomic features
  - &lt;span style="color:lightblue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;35.8%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; promoter related 

--

#### Large AMRs (&gt;=200 CpG sites)

  - &lt;span style="color:lightblue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;11 large AMR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (spanning some really interesting regions, i.e. *PCDH*, *HOX*)

--

#### Genetic variation across AMR

  - &lt;span style="color:lightblue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2,388&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; AMR have no common SNPs (very little genetic variation)

# Summary
.large[
  - implemented a custom bioinformatic pipeline  
]
&lt;br /&gt;
.large[
  - generated a genome-wide 'map' of AMRs  
  
    + allows exploration of the genomic landscape and features
]
&lt;br /&gt;
.large[
  - identified **ASM hotspots** overlapping non-coding RNA and other important functional loci  
  
    + **might account for the number of GWAS hits outside of genes?**
]
