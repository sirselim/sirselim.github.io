      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to work with the people of Norfolk Island since 2010 during my PhD through to present with aspects of my postdoc research.
 Norfolk Island is a remote island in the Pacific that has a unique and well-documented history and genealogy that makes its population an ideal candidate for genetic research. The finding of a population as genetically unique and geographically isolated as Norfolk Island is very rare and is therefore of vital importance in the field of human genetic research.</description>
