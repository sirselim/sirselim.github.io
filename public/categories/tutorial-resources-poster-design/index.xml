      <description>This is just a small comment piece I put together on [my] ideas behind the philosophy of design and scientific posters. It also includes quite a few links to sites and blogs that I have found useful and have got a lot of inspiration from.
You can download these in pdf form here if you like printing documents to read later.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the process of adding this material as an online post, so check back often!</description>
