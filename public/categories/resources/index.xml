      <description>This is a list of resources that I&amp;rsquo;ve found useful to combine as a handout for students (from teaching a range of different courses).
You can download the list in pdf form here if you like printing documents to read later.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the process of adding this material as an online post, so check back often!</description>
