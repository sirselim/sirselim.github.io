      <description>This is a workshop I put together during my PhD in attempt to help others wanting to learn and ultise the power of R in their studies/work.
In the mean time, a pdf version of this workshop can be downloaded here.
Note: This workshop was last updated on the 5th October 2012, and I have good intentions of updating it - therefore it is a work in progress and may contain some dead links and outdated software versions, however the core concepts are still accurate.</description>
