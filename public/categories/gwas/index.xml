      <description>In this workshop we will explore the basics of performing Genomewide Association Studies (GWAS) using a combination of the software plink (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/) and R (http://www.r-project.org/).
At a later stage (a separate workshop) we will also introduce the GenABEL package which offers additional functionality of genomic association analyses in R.
This workshop is written to be accessible to a range of people, from those that have never performed any command-line work, to those that just want a refresher.</description>
