      <description>I recently noticed that my / (root) partition was not so slowly running out of space. This was somewhat alarming as I&amp;rsquo;d given it a generous 23Gb of SSD space which is surely overkill for a Debian install&amp;hellip;
Well it turns out that the culprit was R, more specifically the default site-library located in /usr/local/lib/R/site-library:
$ sudo du -h /usr/local/lib/R/site-library 6.0G	/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/  That&amp;rsquo;s 6Gb of R packages dominating my root directory, thanks Bioconductor!</description>

      <description>Power calculations are an essential element of good experimental design. They can inform on appropriate sample sizes to detect effects of a given size with varying degrees of confidence, or even provide information on the degree of confidence one will have within the confines of a small sample size and the maximum effect sizes one would expect to detect.
It may just be me, but there always seems to be something mystically ‘scary’ about power calculations, peoples perception of them, and how to go about them (until recently I’m not ashamed to have included myself in all 3!</description>
