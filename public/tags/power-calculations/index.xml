      <description>Power calculations are an essential element of good experimental design. They can inform on appropriate sample sizes to detect effects of a given size with varying degrees of confidence, or even provide information on the degree of confidence one will have within the confines of a small sample size and the maximum effect sizes one would expect to detect.
