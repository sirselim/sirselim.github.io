      <description>I recently noticed that my / (root) partition was not so slowly running out of space. This was somewhat alarming as I&amp;rsquo;d given it a generous 23Gb of SSD space which is surely overkill for a Debian install&amp;hellip;
Well it turns out that the culprit was R, more specifically the default site-library located in /usr/local/lib/R/site-library:
$ sudo du -h /usr/local/lib/R/site-library 6.0G	/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/  That&amp;rsquo;s 6Gb of R packages dominating my root directory, thanks Bioconductor!</description>
