      <description>This is a basic EWAS tutorial, introducing concepts for analysing methylation data.
There is a webpage version of the tutorial located here. You can load this and follow along as you run through this on your computer, if you wish to copy paste code please feel free to do so.
Data The workshop uses public Illumina 450K data from several studies (GSE40279, GSE48472, GSE41114, GSE42700, GSE46573, GSE48472, GSE50586). It is currently designed to investigate the methylation differences between blood (whole blood) and buccal (cheek swabs) tissues.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Genomewide Association Studies</title>
      <link>/2015/06/26/gwas-workshop/</link>

      <guid>/2015/06/26/gwas-workshop/</guid>
      <description>In this workshop we will explore the basics of performing Genomewide Association Studies (GWAS) using a combination of the software plink (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/) and R (http://www.r-project.org/).
At a later stage (a separate workshop) we will also introduce the GenABEL package which offers additional functionality of genomic association analyses in R.
This workshop is written to be accessible to a range of people, from those that have never performed any command-line work, to those that just want a refresher.</description>

      <title>Basic Inkscape Scientific Poster Design Workshop</title>
      <link>/2014/09/11/poster-workshop/</link>

      <guid>/2014/09/11/poster-workshop/</guid>
      <description>This is a very brief initial workshop designed to introduce Inkscape. The main goal here is to get a general overview of how to create a poster layout with Inkscape, get familiar with the software, and understand a little about putting a scientific poster together.
A pdf version of this workshop can be downloaded here.
I&amp;rsquo;m aiming to have an online version of this workshop avaiable in the not too distant future, watch this space!</description>

      <description>This is a list of resources that I&amp;rsquo;ve found useful to combine as a handout for students (from teaching a range of different courses).
You can download the list in pdf form here if you like printing documents to read later.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the process of adding this material as an online post, so check back often!</description>

      <description>This is just a small comment piece I put together on [my] ideas behind the philosophy of design and scientific posters. It also includes quite a few links to sites and blogs that I have found useful and have got a lot of inspiration from.
You can download these in pdf form here if you like printing documents to read later.

      <guid>/2013/07/01/r-workshop/</guid>
      <description>This is a workshop I put together during my PhD in attempt to help others wanting to learn and ultise the power of R in their studies/work.
In the mean time, a pdf version of this workshop can be downloaded here.
Note: This workshop was last updated on the 5th October 2012, and I have good intentions of updating it - therefore it is a work in progress and may contain some dead links and outdated software versions, however the core concepts are still accurate.</description>
