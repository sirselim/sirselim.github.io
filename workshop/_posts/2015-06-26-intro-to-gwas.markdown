##Introduction to Genomewide Association Studies using PLINK and R###

###Overview

In this workshop we will explore the basics of performing Genomewide Association Studies (GWAS) using a combination of the software `plink` (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/) and `R` (http://www.r-project.org/).

At a later stage (a separate workshop) we will also introduce the `GenABEL` package which offers additional functionality of genomic association analyses in `R`.

This workshop is written to be accessible to a range of people, from those that have never performed any command-line work, to those that just want a refresher. As such I have written it to include clear and straight forward outlines of all `R` and plink operations, most of the time stepping through these one line at at time.

###Workshop Manual

The workshop manual is available in the form of the `GWAS_workshop.pdf` file from my GitHub, here is the [repository](https://github.com/sirselim/Intro_to_GWAS). This contains all the information and code to run through the entire workshop, as well as hopefully helpful information.
