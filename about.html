    I have just completed my PhD exploring the underlying genetic susceptibility to obesity and metabolic disorders in the Norfolk Island population isolate. My main areas of interest are Bioinformatics and Computational Genetics, and I also have an active interest in population genetics. My current work involves the creation of methods to deal with, and analyse, large genomic data sets, including incorporation of multiple layers of both phenotypic and genomic data.
