      <description>In this workshop we will explore the basics of performing Genomewide Association Studies (GWAS) using a combination of the software plink (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/) and R (http://www.r-project.org/).
At a later stage (a separate workshop) we will also introduce the GenABEL package which offers additional functionality of genomic association analyses in R.
This workshop is written to be accessible to a range of people, from those that have never performed any command-line work, to those that just want a refresher.</description>

      <description>This is just a small comment piece I put together on [my] ideas behind the philosophy of design and scientific posters. It also includes quite a few links to sites and blogs that I have found useful and have got a lot of inspiration from.
You can download these in pdf form here if you like printing documents to read later.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the process of adding this material as an online post, so check back often!</description>

      <description>This is a workshop I put together during my PhD in attempt to help others wanting to learn and ultise the power of R in their studies/work.
In the mean time, a pdf version of this workshop can be downloaded here.
Note: This workshop was last updated on the 5th October 2012, and I have good intentions of updating it - therefore it is a work in progress and may contain some dead links and outdated software versions, however the core concepts are still accurate.</description>
