      <description>This is a very brief initial workshop designed to introduce Inkscape. The main goal here is to get a general overview of how to create a poster layout with Inkscape, get familiar with the software, and understand a little about putting a scientific poster together.
A pdf version of this workshop can be downloaded here.
I&amp;rsquo;m aiming to have an online version of this workshop avaiable in the not too distant future, watch this space!</description>

      <description>This is just a small comment piece I put together on [my] ideas behind the philosophy of design and scientific posters. It also includes quite a few links to sites and blogs that I have found useful and have got a lot of inspiration from.
You can download these in pdf form here if you like printing documents to read later.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the process of adding this material as an online post, so check back often!</description>
