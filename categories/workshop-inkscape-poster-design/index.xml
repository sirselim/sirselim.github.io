      <description>###Introduction to Inkscape and Scientific Poster Design###
This is a very brief initial workshop designed to introduce Inkscape. The main goal here is to get a general overview of how to create a poster layout with Inkscape, get familiar with the software, and understand a little about putting a scientific poster together.
A pdf version of this workshop can be downloaded here.
I&amp;rsquo;m aiming to have an online version of this workshop avaiable in the not too distant future, watch this space!</description>
