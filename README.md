==================

This is my personal website and blog that I initially set up to explore the functionality of Github pages.

This is my first foray into blogging and maintaining a website, an experience that I've found I really enjoy. The current iteration of the site is built around (and from) a series of different pieces of software:

  - GitHub pages to host the site
  - Jekyll and Markdown to create and maintain the blogging functionality
  - SublimeText 3 currently for HTML and Markdown editing
  - RMarkdown through knitr and pandoc to beautify all R based posts/guides
  - Gitbook and RGitbook for creating and publishing books/manuals/tutorials

###About me: 

I recently completed my PhD exploring the underlying genetic susceptibility to obesity and metabolic disorders in the Norfolk Island population isolate. My main areas of research are **Bioinformatics** and **Computational Genetics**. 
I am currently a Post Doctoral Research Fellow at QUT working on the creation of methods to deal with, and analyse, large genomic data sets, including the incorporation of multiple layers of both phenotypic and genomic data. I work on a range of complex human disorders, including; obesity and type-2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, migraine, ovarian cancer and asthma.

Again, this is my personal site and as such all opinions expressed are my own.

###To do:

A list of things I'd like to implement or change when I get the time:

  - general design overhaul
  - a photography section (for some of my shots)
  - a decent archiving section for older blog posts
