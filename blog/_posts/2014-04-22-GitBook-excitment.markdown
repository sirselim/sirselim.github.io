A very brief post today - more to remind myself to check this out in more detail when I have time!

A new tool from Git has got me rather excited, [GitBook](http://www.gitbook.io/).

> GitBook is a command line tool (and Node.js library) for building beautiful
> programming books and exercises using GitHub/Git and Markdown.
> 
> GitBook can generate your book in the following formats:
> 
>   - Static Website: This is the default format, it generates a complete interactive static website that can be for example hosted on GitHub Pages.
>   - PDF: A complete PDF book with exercise solutions at the end of the book.
>   - eBook: A complete eBook with exercise solutions at the end of the book.
>   - Single Page: The book will be stored in a single printable HTML page, this format is used for conversion to PDF or eBook.

The ability to save as a website, pdf or ebook is fantastic.

There is a fairly nifty, and minimal (which is a good thing), [editor available](https://github.com/GitbookIO/editor) for Linux/Mac/Win which makes writing your first interactive book and publishing it to your desired format dead easy.

There is already a push to get integration with RMarkdown: [Using GitBook with RMarkdown](http://jason.bryer.org/posts/2014-04-18/Gitbook_with_R_Markdown.html)

If I get a chance I'll recreate and update my introduction to R workshop manual using GitBook. This would make it much more viable for online distrbution and viewing, and will provide an nice introduction into using the GitBook Markdown system from book writing... I've been really enjoying Markdown for blogging and report writing, so 'book' writing is the next logical step.

This could also be a great resource for teaching; live websites (GitBooks) on the source material that can be readily hosted and downloaded/forked as needed.

GitBook is an opensource project, check [here](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook) for the GitHub home for further details or to fork.

Great times ahead.
