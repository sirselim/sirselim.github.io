## First post on this GitHub pages site

This is my first attempt at setting up a personal website and blogging system. I thought I'd add a list of essential software that I am running to get this all up and working:

1. GitHub pages to host the site;
2. Jekyll and Markdown to create and maintain the blogging functionality;
3. SublimeText 3 currently for HTML and Markdown editing (currently tossing up between ReText, Gedit & Sublime).

On the to-do list is integrating RMarkdown functionality via knitr.

More to come soon!
