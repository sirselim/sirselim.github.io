Every year I teach a couple of post-graduate level course's on the topic of designing and presenting scientific posters. Where possible I encourage students to create their own images, which has lead to some fantastic (and artistic!) results. However, sometimes it may just not be feasible 

Most major search engines have the ability (in advanced search options) to restrict an image search to varying degrees of creative-commons license. The concept behind these, and copyrights in general, can be confusing, and it can be difficult to determine whether or not it's OK to reuse an image in ones own work. Enter this helpful flowchart:

The chart comes from Curtis Newbold, [The Visual Communication Guy](http://thevisualcommunicationguy.com/2014/07/14/can-i-use-that-picture/), and explains copyright, fair use, creative commons, and public domain in a nice logical manner. If you're stuck trying to decide your rights around use of an image you found on the internet, give this a go.

If you are interested please do have a more in depth look through Curtis's [website]((http://thevisualcommunicationguy.com) as there is some really insightful information within.
