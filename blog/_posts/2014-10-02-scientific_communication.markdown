## How-to's of writing scientific communications

Very brief post to remind me to go back and read these in more detail!

I've recently been asked to submit a couple of articles to Nature. One thing that seems to be an absolute must for even getting a look in to a journal such as this is a well written cover letter. Hence I went on the hunt for any tips/tricks/suggestions that were scattered around the internet. My search returned something really interesting in the way of a series of informative blog posts from the Nature website itself.  

The first and most pertinent to me at this point in time being:

**"How to write a cover letter"** http://blogs.nature.com/methagora/2013/09/how-to-write-a-cover-letter.html

This was put together for Nature Methods, but I believe that the major take home points apply to any good covering letter. It is a well written short post worth the read, but I'll summerise my take home points here.

>  1. Do give a brief, largely non-technical summary of the method. 
>  2. Do put the work in context. 
>  3. Do suggest referees. 
>  4. Do tell us about any related work from your group under consideration or in press elsewhere. 
>  5. Do mention any unusual circumstances. 
>  6. Do mention if you have previously discussed the work with an editor.

There are three posts in this series, with the other two being:

**"How to write a rebuttal letter"** http://blogs.nature.com/methagora/2013/09/how-to-write-a-rebuttal-letter.html 

**"How to write an appeal letter"** http://blogs.nature.com/methagora/2013/09/how-to-write-an-appeal-letter.html

I will hopefully get a chance to digest and comment on the the other two in the not too distant future.
